# Bibliometric_Study_Mathematical_Oncology

1. On interdisciplinarity in mathematical oncology (Section 3.1), Figure 2b-2d can be generated using the codes jupyter notebook Interdisciplinarity.ipynb.
2. On internationality in mathematical oncology (Section 3.2), Figure 3a can be generated using the codes in jupyter notebook Internationality.ipynb. To plot Figure 3b upload the metadata to biblioshiny, filter the necessary years, and then go to "Social Structure" and "Countries' Collaboration World Map".
3. On collaboration in mathematical oncology (Section 3.3), Figure 4 can be generated using the codes in the jupyter notebook Collaboration.ipynb.
4. On trending topics in mathematical oncology (Section 3.4), the frequencies of words used in Figures 5 and 6 are downloaded from biblioshiny "Documents" and "WordCloud". They were plotted using the code word_clouds.R.
